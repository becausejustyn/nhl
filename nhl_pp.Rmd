Justyn, it's 5am - why are you doing this?

```{r}
library(plotly)
library(tidyverse)
#library(RCurl)
```

```{r}
maybe <- read_csv("https://moneypuck.com/moneypuck/playerData/careers/gameByGame/all_teams.csv")
```

```{r}
maybe <- maybe %>%
  mutate(team = str_replace_all(
    team,
    c(
      "ATL" = "WPG",
      "L.A" = "LAK",
      "N.J" = "NJD",
      "S.J" = "SJS",
      "T.B" = "TBL"
    )
  ))
```
